So don’t tell Mom, but I’m thinking of moving to [pnoun] after I finish school. We don’t really know a whole lot about them, but we’re trading with them and travelling there now, so like that means a whole new demographic we can sell our shit to! And I think the cost of living there is supposed to be like super cheap or something. I don’t know, I think it could be a good idea.
