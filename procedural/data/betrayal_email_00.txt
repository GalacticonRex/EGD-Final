I can’t think of anything else we can do. We’re fucked. We’re going under. We’ve been in this business for 18 years. Undone by some [pnoun 0] kids and some silly [noun 0]. Their design is so sleek though. I can’t believe we’ve never thought to build a [noun 1] before. I’m going to stop by the [pnoun] [noun] to take a look at it. Maybe rub my face on it to see if I can absorb its greatness through osmosis. I don’t know, it’s killing me. I’ve run out of ideas. Take care.
