Dear Journal,
My therapist said that I should keep a mood journal. Write things that are bothering me to help out with my anxiety. I think it’s kind of stupid. I haven’t written in a journal or a diary since I was 13. I don’t really know what to say. I’m okay right now, I think? A little worried about classes. And my vacation plans got cancelled.
Mom was gonna take us to [Zerg] for my birthday, but what with everything that’s been going on there and the [travel ban], we’ve had to cancel. Mom keeps telling my aunt and cousins to move  over here. She’s afraid things will get worse, that we might go to war with them even. 
But that’s crazy. [Zergians] and [Bobians] have always been allies. [Zerg]’s like [Bob]’s little brother. That would be insane, right? But anything’s possible, and there’s already been so much tension between us.
Oh God, we’re going to go to war. We have to get my aunt out of there. What’s going to happen to them? Will [Zerg] let them come to [Bob]? Oh God, they’re going to die.
I- we’ll figure it out. I can’t control this right now. We’ve got time. We’ll figure it out.
